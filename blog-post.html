                        "**Simulate the Environment:** Don't just study on your bed. Sit at a desk, set a timer, and practice recalling information without looking at your notes. This trains your brain to function under \"exam conditions\" so the real thing feels less shocking.",
                        "**The \"Brain Dump\" Method:** The moment the test starts, write down any formulas, dates, or mnemonics you are afraid of forgetting on the back of the exam paper. This offloads the information from your working memory, reducing cognitive load and anxiety.",
                        "**Post-Test Perspective:** Regardless of the grade, every test is data. It tells you what study methods worked and what didn't. Treat it as a diagnostic tool for your future success, not a judgment of your intelligence.",

                        "**2. The 50/10 Rule:** For every 50 minutes of focused work, take a 10-minute break completely away from screens. Walk outside, stretch, or grab a snack.",
                        "**3. Connect, Don't just \"Like\":** Scrolling through social media can increase feelings of isolation. Instead, call a friend or study via FaceTime. Genuine connection releases oxytocin, which lowers stress.",
                        "**4. Move Your Body:** You don't need to run a marathon. A 15-minute walk resets your dopamine levels and improves focus.",

Wake up at the same time, get dressed as if you are going to school, and designate a specific spot for studying that is not your bed. This cues your brain that it is time to work, and more importantly, allows you to \"leave\" school when the day is done.",
                        "**Practice Gratitude:** It is easy to focus on what we have lost this year. Try writing down three small things you are grateful for every morning. It could be as simple as a good cup of coffee or a sunny afternoon. This simple habit rewires your brain to scan the world for positives rather than threats.",
